Hardware Installation
=====================

Installing into a Chassis
-------------------------

The VAB-820 can be fitted into any chassis that has the mounting holes
compatible with the standard Pico-ITX mounting hole locations. Additionally,
the chassis must meet the minimum height requirements for specified areas of
the mainboard.

Suggested minimum chassis dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The figure below shows the suggested minimum space requirements that a
chassis should have in order to work well with the VAB-820.

   Suggested minimum chassis dimensions

Each side of the mainboard should have a buffer zone from the internal wall
of the chassis. The side of the mainboard that accommodates the I/O coastline
should have a buffer of 1.00 mm. The side on the opposite end of the I/O
coastline should have a buffer of at least 4.00 mm. The two sides adjacent to
the I/O coastline should have at least a 10.00 mm buffer.

Suggested minimum chassis height
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The figure below shows the suggested minimum height requirements for the
internal space of the chassis. It is not necessary for the internal ceiling to be
evenly flat. What is required is that the internal ceiling height must be strictly
observed for each section that is highlighted.

leave unobstructed.

Installing the Mini-PCIe module
-------------------------------

**Step 1**

Align the notch on the Mini-PCIe module with the counterpart on the Mini-
PCIe slot then insert the module at 30Â° angle.

**Step 2**

Once the module has been fully inserted, push down the module until the
screw holes align with the mounting holes on the hex spacer screws. Secure
the module with two screws to the standoffs.

Installing the Heatsink (VAB-820 SKU)
-------------------------------------

**Step 1**

Align the heatsink over the three mounting holes. Use three washers and three
M3 bolts to fix the heatsink.

**Step 2**

Secure the heatsink by tightening all the bolts firmly.

**Step 3**

Install the board to a system by using three M2 screws. For the unused
mounting hole, use a M3 screw to secure it to the system.

Installing the Heatsink & PWB-P255-L PD power board (VAB-820-P SKU)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Step 1**

Apply the thermal grease (about 0.06 cc) on top of the processor before
installing the heatsink.

**Step 2**

Align the heatsink over the four mounting holes. Use two 10 mm bolts, one
11.7 mm bolts and one M3*6 screw to fix the heatsink on top of the board
(please refer to the figure below for the placement). Secure the bolts and the
screw with four M3 nuts on the bottom side of the board.

**Step 3**

Align the PD power board over the heatsink, secure the PD power board to
the bolts with three M3*6 screws. PoE connectors from the PD power board
will be firmly inserted in the PoE pin headers of the VAB-820 board.

.. warning:: When the PD power board is installed, connect the DC-in power jack to the DC-in power connector
	     that is on the PD power board, not the one on the VAB-820
